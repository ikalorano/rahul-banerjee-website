        <p class="general-para">
            Synthesising the traditional anarchism of the Bhil Adivasis, the ancient Indian anarchism of the Charvaka,
            the
            Vedas
            and the Buddha, the modern anarchism of Proudhon, Bakunin, the late Marx of the period after the publication
            of
            Das
            Kapital when he came to acknowledge the validity of the anarchist path of the Russian People's Will
            Anarchists
            and
            Gandhi and the views of various schools of feminism, I have formulated my own school of thought of
            anarcho-environmentalism which is detailed below. This also draws on the philosophies of cynicism, green
            anarchism
            and naturalism. Twentieth century science has established the preponderance of chance in the evolution of
            the
            universe in general and life on earth in particular. Natural processes are probabilistic. Therefore, I have
            rejected
            the teleology and determinism that is the bane of most philosophies.
        </p>
        <p class="general-para">
            Caste oppression is a major problem in India, especially of the Dalits, and working as I do to try and
            mitigate
            it,
            I have also imbibed the emancipatory philosophy of Bhimrao Ambedkar, especially his seminal interpretation
            of
            Buddhism which he has termed as Navayana - The Buddhist concept of "Dukha" or sorrow has been reinterpreted
            by
            Ambedkar as the exploitation of the poor and the concept of "Nirvana" has been interpreted not as a
            metaphysical
            state or attainment of freedom, but as the achievement of a real society founded in peace and justice.
            Despite
            the
            immense difficulty of pursuing these anarcho-environmentalist programmes in a world that is heavily
            centralised
            in
            all respects, I have stuck to this task, which I have categorised as being Sisyphean, inspired by the
            philosophical
            reinterpretation of the Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus wherein he visualises Sisyphus as happy despite his
            absurd
            predicament of having to continuously roll a rock uphill only to see it roll down again. This comprehensive
            anarcho-environmentalist worldview encompassing these various schools of thought provides the philosophical
            foundation of the extensive work that I do on the ground to set up decentralised socio-economically
            equitable
            and
            environmentally sustainable communities.

        <p class="general-para">
            Anarcho-environmentalism is a school of thought that emphasises the need for a pronounced environmentalist
            worldview
            within the larger anarchist worldview. It is different from naturalism in the sense that it is a modern
            philosophy
            that takes into account the devastation caused by industrial development which was not there at the time of
            the
            naturalists like Diogenes. It is also different from the environmentalism of John Ruskin because even though
            the
            latter did inveigh against industrialisation and its adverse environmental impact, it had a distinct
            christian
            evangelical character whereas anarcho-environmentalism is atheistic in character. That it is within the
            larger
            anarchist fold makes it different from the environmentalism of the liberals who do not question the
            vailidity of
            industrialisation but only seek to mitigate its adverse environmental impacts. It is also different from
            eco-anarchism or green anarchism because it stresses environmentalism that is the primacy of nature over
            humans
            and
            says that anarchism is the only form of human organisation that can ensure the primacy of nature. It is also
            different from the spontaneous animism and minimalism of the indigenous people in that it is a conscious
            philosophical formulation.

            Nature is paramount and so humans must live in harmony with nature. <br>
          Human organisation must be in line with Anarchist principles of stateless communities based on direct
                democracy and minimal individual property accumulation. <br>
           Women must be equal participants with men in all decision making and action <br>
           Unarmed Mass action is required on the ground to establish an anarcho-environmentalist civilisation.
                Unarmed
                because armed struggle is not possible by anarchist groups against the centralised and heavily armed
                modern
                state. <br>

        <p class="general-para">
            The most well known form of Indian anarchism is Gandhism. However, there was a fundamental problem with
            Gandhism
            that it was funded by the nascent Indian capitalists and so its prescriptions remained on the periphery of
            the
            development path adopted by the independent Indian State. Anarcho-environmentalism on the other hand being
            in
            the
            classical anarchist mould clearly states that capitalism must be dispensed with. Anarchists are not
            necessarily
            free
            of patriarchal views as its founder Proudhon was highly patriarchal. In this respect too
            Anarcho-environmentalism is
            different because it espouses feminism. An important feature of this philosophy is its action oriented
            nature
            and
            extensive practice. Thus, in its action oriented character it is similar to Marxism which too according to
            Marx
            set
            out to change the world rather than just interpret it. However, unlike Marxism, which is teleological and
            utopian in
            nature, Anarcho-environmentalism does not posit any utopian future towards which action has to be oriented
            and
            instead concentrates on practical decentralised solutions to socio-economic and environmental problems.
