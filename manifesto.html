        <h1 class="general-heading">An Anarcho-Environmentalist Manifesto</h1>
        <p class="general-para">
            The beneficial limits of centralised governance and modern industrial development being pushed by
            all-powerful nation states and multilateral institutions have been reached. The harmful side effects are
            becoming increasingly manifest in the form of serious environmental problems and widespread poverty all over
            the world. Despite formal democratic institutions real power has not devolved to the common people and their
            voices are not being heard. So people's discontent is on the rise leading to increasing violence the world
            over.
        </p>

        <p class="general-para">
            All over the world the major burden of the tremendous costs of this kind of development and governance have
            historically been borne by the indigenous people. In India too this sordid state of affairs exists and the
            tribals, adivasis or indigenous people as they are variously called have been affected negatively. Analysis
            of the tribal predicament in India has established conclusively that the institutions set up under the
            provisions of the Constitution of India for their betterment have not functioned properly and the various
            laws enacted from time to time for their protection have not been implemented, primarily due to the wrong
            development policies adopted by the state. These have tended to strengthen the political and economic power
            of the already powerful castes vis-a-vis the tribals.
        </p>

        <p class="general-para">
            From the nineteen eighties there have been a number of grassoots people's organisational initiatives in the
            Central Indian region that have attempted to creatively synthesize the democratic space provided by the
            enabling provisions in the Constitution and many other protective acts and the traditional consensus based
            mass democratic practices of the adivasis to evolve a new theory and practice of decentralised politics and
            sustainable development that can be called Anarcho-Environmentalism. It is notable that these organisations
            like the Adivasi Ekta Parishad, Narmada Bachao Andolan, Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha, Kisan Adivasi Sangathan,
            Khedut Mazdoor Chetna
            Sangath and Adivasi Mukti Sangathan to name just a few have through their innovative economic, social and
            political action made a name for themselves worldwide. A detailed description and critical analysis of the
            goals, achievements and failures of these movements has been undertaken in this book and it ends by
            providing pointers towards the solution of the serious social, economic and environmental problems that face
            humanity at the present juncture.
        </p>

        <p class="general-para">
            Consequently, this book is in a broad sense a manifesto of Anarcho-Environmentalism. The epic story telling
            style of the Bhil adivasis of central India who are its main protagonists has been adopted in it. The tales
            of their struggles as well as the analysis of these are presented through the life experiences of two of the
            activists associated with the people's movements - the author and his wife Subhadra Khaperde. The narrative
            has in addition a rich mixture of various other stories and histories ancient and modern, local and global.
            The stories are all liberally laced with humour with not a single chapter going barren in this respect.
            There is also an element of suspense as the plot builds up through the various micro narratives some
            personal, some organisational, some mythical and some historical, woven together into the meta-narrative of
            the overall struggle against destructive modern development. Finally the tale reaches a very entertaining,
            well-argued and philosophically uncommon climax in the end.
        </p>

            Despite the fact that these anarcho-environmentalist movements have not been able to make a mass impact big
            enough to be able to achieve what they have set out to do, they have nevertheless succeeded in underlining
            the crucial need for ensuring environmental sanity and socio-economic justice. Analysing in detail the
            characteristics of the present dominant development model and the reasons for its hegemony the book ends by
            charting out a course to keep pegging at changing it for the better. The ending is a positive one providing
            a modus operandi whereby even ordinary people can singly or in groups act to bring about a saner
            socio-economic and environmental dispensation. The whole book can be downloaded from the accompanying page

                        Using a Bhili language metaphor for the ability to write it is argued that the activists of the
                        mass
                        environmental movements in India have not been able to put black on white in the same way as the
                        illiterate adivasis. That is the environmental activists have not been able to write
                        entertainingly
                        about their experiences and so have failed to garner enough public opinion in support of their
                        work.
                        A Bhili fable about a woman's tongue being cut off because she spoke against her husband on the
                        orders of the patriarchal village council, which also recommended that the husband swallow it is
                        mentioned. The fact that in the fable the tongue remains stuck in the husband's throat leaves
                        the
                        possibility that it can be recovered. The name of the book is taken from this Bhili fable, as it
                        is
                        a description of the organised efforts of marginalised people trying to speak out against their
                        oppression, which they had previously been suffering mutely in a culture of silence.

                        This chapter details the way in which the Bhil adivasis have been deprived of their traditional
                        resource bases over the centuries. Special emphasis is given on the role of the British in
                        introducing agricultural and forest policies, which were inimical to the interests of the
                        adivasis.
                        It is also stressed that the independent Indian state has continued the British policies leading
                        to
                        the continuing devastation of the adivasis' livelihoods and culture. The glorious history of the

                        years when the organisation process around local issues went on with relative success as the

                        A brief tongue in cheek description of the worldview of the Bhil adivasis, in which love plays a
                        dominant role, is provided here. It is shown that this worldview is fundamentally at odds with
                        the
                        Hindu ascetic worldview on which Gandhism is based and so there is little possibility of a large

                        The environmental activists are anarchists in the sense that they are in favour of
                        decentralisation
                        of both governance and economic activity and want to reduce the role of the centralised state.
                        As
                        such they are faced with a Catch 22 situation in that to fight centralised states effectively
                        centralised mass organisations have to be built up which is anathema to their beliefs. This is
                        the
                        dilemma that has confronted all anarchists in India from the time of Gandhi, the first conscious
                        political Indian anarchist of the modern era. There has been no satisfactory resolution of this
                        problem and so the anarchists have remained on the fringe of politics. Gandhi himself was
                        sidelined
                        after independence, as his call to dissolve the Indian National Congress was not heeded by the
                        other
                        leaders of the party. Subsequently his programme of village uplift too was given the go by.
                        Since
                        then mainstream electoral politics has become mired in corruption and foul play and first the
                        socialists and communists and now the environmental activists have not been able to influence
                        state
                        policy in favour of the poor and oppressed sections of society and for better environmental

                        fulfilling of anarchist goals is discussed in this chapter. It is argued that the British set up
                        the
                        bureaucracy for their imperial interests. The anti-people attitude of the bureaucracy has
                        carried on
                        after independence because it suited the new rulers to use the old structure for pushing through
                        their own sectarian interests. Some sensitive bureaucrats who have tried to buck the trend have
                        had
                        to eventually resign from the bureaucracy. The work of one such person Aruna Roy, who has become

                        has
                        the higher judiciary shown some feeling for the poor while the lower judiciary is still

                        the final act of rebellion of the adivasis against the injustice of the state at Mehendikhera
                        village in Dewas district in Madhya Pradesh in 2001. This chapter describes how the various
                        institutions of the state combine against an organisation of the adivasis and illegally suppress
                        its
                        just demands. Even though this mobilisation has taken place within the bounds of wholly legal
                        statutes yet the state has not countenanced the challenge to its authority that is the logical
                        result of demanding the operationalisation of grassroots democracy in both letter and spirit.
                        This
                        tragic culmination of two decades of mass organisational work for saner development and human
                        governance policies in the central Indian region drives home the tremendous difficulty of
                        conducting
                        such work.

                        The economic and political bases of modern industrial development the world over and its effects
                        on
                        agriculture and the environment are discussed in detail in this lengthy and penultimate chapter.
                        Not
                        only in Mehendikhera but elsewhere in the world people's rights to natural resources are being
                        roughly trodden over because of this kind of development. The retrograde effects of the
                        "Washington
                        Consensus" between the USA, World Bank and the IMF are underlined. It is conclusively shown that
                        the
                        only way to save Terra Madre or Mother Earth and so humanity is to cut back on the present
                        greedy
                        consumption and destruction of natural resources in pursuit of profit and wealth.

                        The thrust of the argument here is that there is no scope any more for dreaming of utopian
                        societies. One must instead fight for a better socio-economic dispensation in the present
                        without
                        having recourse to grand theories and utopian visions. An entertaining survey of the history of
                        political and philosophical thought right from ancient times has been undertaken to describe the
                        intellectual contest between the animists - those who believe in some deterministic power or law
                        that governs human destiny and the naturalists - those who believe that all existence is
                        contingent,
                        unpredictable and dependent on nature. Finally the reinterpretation of the Greek myth of
                        Sisyphus by
                        the French philosopher Albert Camus is mentioned to stress that the naturalist view of life is
                        the
                        only reasonable one. With examples of the modern myth breaking efforts of Amnesty International
                        it
                        is shown that it is possible to confront the tremendous power of the mythmakers if one has the
                        resolve to do so.

                    Print Version of the Book
                    <p class="general-para">
                        A number of people downloaded and read the book with enjoyment and my long time friend from
                        school and
                        fellow activist <a href="http://cuckooscall.blogspot.com">Ramaswamy</a>, mentioned it in his
                        blog. <a href="http://readerswords.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Bhupinder Singh</a>, a
                        political thinker
                        and literary reviewer happened to read this post
                        and he then read the book and did a detailed review of the book which he posted in various
                        blogs. This
                        in
                        turn resulted in more people reading the book and eventually
                        <a href="http://gaddeswarup.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Anandswarup Gadde</a> also a political
                        thinker
                        apart from
                        being a mathematician expressed the
                        desire to fund its publication in print. This set off a new project as the feedback that I was
                        receiving
                        from many readers was that the stories in the book were very entertaining but the academic
                        analysis
                        along
                        with these stories was proving to be too arcane to understand. So it was decided that an edited
                        version
                        of
                        the book would be prepared for print. Bhupinder who by now has become a fast friend took on this
                        onerous
                        responsibility and reworked the entire book to make it more readable and finally <a
                            href="http://bhaswatighosh.com/" target="_blank">Bhaswati Ghosh</a> a writer and
                        professional editor
                        with a strong
                        social outlook put in her imprint
                        to give it printable shape and form. The print version of the book is thus a sign of the times
                        in
                        that it is a collaborative product of the social networking that has become possible as a result
                        of the
