        <h1 class="general-heading">Survival Edge Technology</h1>
        <h2 class="general-intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="general-para">
            Survival Edge Technology is the assortment of simple technologies that can be implemented by communities
            through
            collective action to mitigate the agriculture, water, energy and climate crises that face humanity. The
            adverse
            effects of the above mentioned crises are felt most by women due to the patriarchal nature of society.
            Therefore, an important aspect of Survival Edge Technology is the agency of women in its planning and
            implementation as communitarian cooperation alone is not enough.
        </p>


        <h3 class="general-intro-head">Etymology</h3>
        <p class="general-para">

            The need for such a terminology has arisen because of the fascination of the dominant development paradigm
            with
            centralized high investment cutting edge technology, which is ironically offered as a panacea for the
            agricultural,
            energy, water and climate crises that it has created. Thus, this new terminology combines and gives
            visibility
            to
            the various simple technologies being implemented by communities across the world through collective action
            to
            conserve the environment in a sustainable and equitable manner. The new term can be defined as follows –
            “Decentralized and communitarian work in soil and water conservation, sustainable agriculture, afforestation
            and
            renewable energy needs to be done extensively if the human race is to survive the deepening water, food,
            energy
            and
            climate crises. Moreover, since these crises most affect the poor who live on the edge of survival in rural
            areas,
            the decentralized communitarian technology required to mitigate these crises can appropriately be called
            Survival
            Edge Technology".
        </p>


        <h2 class="general-intro"> Components</h2>
        <p class="general-para">
            Presently this technology is being implemented by the NGO, Mahila Jagat Lihaaz Samiti and the mass
            organisations
            Khedut
            Mazdoor Chetna Sangath and Kansari Nu Vadavno in Western Madhya Pradesh among the Bhil Adivasis.
            The various components of Survival Edge Technology are as follows –
        </p>

        <!-- Start Afforestation Area -->

        <h3 class="general-intro-head">Afforestation</h3>


        <p class="general-para">
            Growing forests are the best sequesters of carbon and producers of oxygen. They also provide nutrients for
            agriculture
            as the decaying leaves become very good manure. Moreover, they hold the soil and prevent it from being
            eroded. Last
            but
            not the least, forests not only attract rainfall but also recharge this rain into the ground by reducing
            runoff and
            so
            ensure the base flow in streams throughout the year when there is no rainfall. Therefore, afforestation is a
            very
            important activity. In India in the dry land areas afforesting degraded land is a challenge because saplings
            that
            are
            planted during the monsoon cannot withstand the dry heat of the summers when temperatures reach close to 50
            degrees
            centigrade. Therefore, it is easier to protect degraded lands which have root stock from grazing so that
            this root
            stock
            can regenerate and become forests again in a short period of time. The Adivasis of Western Madhya Pradesh
            have done
            precisely this with aplomb.
        </p>

    <!-- Start Soil and Water Conservation Area -->

    <h3 class="general-intro-head">Soil and Water Conservation</h3>

    <p class="general-para">
        Given the scale of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place just afforestation alone is not enough
        and so
        soil and water conservation work has also to be done. Ideally, this should be done in micro-watersheds so as to
        drought
        and flood-proof the catchment of a stream. The work should start from the ridges of the watershed along the
        contours
        and
        come down to the main drainage line. There can be trenches and bunds along the contours and gully plugs across
        the smaller drainages and check dams and tanks on the main drainage line. This work too has been done very well by
        the
        Adivasis of Western Madhya Pradesh.
    </p>

    <!-- Start Renewable Energy Area -->
    <h3 class="general-intro-head">Renewable Energy</h3>

    <p class="general-para">
        Centralized energy generation and then its distribution is a costly affair both in economic and environmental
        terms
        and
        a major reason for the low per capita energy consumption in India. Therefore, renewable energy is a very
        important
        area
        of work.
        This includes passive and active solar, bio-methanation, anaerobic gasification of biomass and wind power. The
        Mahila
        Jagat Lihaaz Samiti is working on all these in various locations.
    </p>


    <!-- Start Water Supply and Sanitation Area -->
    <h3 class="general-intro-head">Water Supply and Sanitation</h3>

    <p class="general-para">
        A major problem currently is the severe lack of potable water and the improper disposal of waste water. This is
        particularly acute in cities many of which have been declared to be about to face zero ground water supply in a
        few
        years and
        so augmentation of ground water through recharging and water harvesting are of the utmost importance.
        Simultaneously
        the
        treatment and reuse
        of waste water and the generation of manure and energy from the faecal toilet and organic kitchen waste is also
        necessary, both
        to improve sanitation and cater to some of the demand for water and energy.
    </p>



    <!-- Sustainable Agriculture -->

    <h3 class="general-intro-head">Sustainable Agriculture </h3>

    <p class="general-para">
        <span class="set-graphic"><img src="images/set-sustainable-agri-graphic-1.jpg" alt="Sustainable Agriculture Graphic second" /></span> 
        <br> External input chemical agriculture has reached
        its limits and yields are declining while costs are increasing.
        This
        agriculture has also led to a huge increase in water demand, resulting in water stress. Hybrid Monocultures have
        also led to a drastic fall in agricultural biodiversity and increased pest attacks. Therefore, there is a need
        for
        reorienting agriculture towards the use of organic resources such as mulch, compost and
        indigenous seed varieties and water harvesting. Simultaneously the cropping has to shift towards less water
        intensive
        varieties which are
        also higher in nutrition. A model for this sustainable agriculture has been developed and is being implemented
        as
        shown.</p>


    <h3 class="general-intro-head"> Communitarian Cooperation </h3>

    <p class="general-para">
        Decentralized technologies can be properly implemented only if there is active communitarian cooperation through
        collective action. The Western Madhya Pradesh region has witnessed such collective action and its methodology is
        as follows -
    </p>
    <ul class="general-list">
        <li> Problem analysis workshops in which the people participate in open discussions to pinpoint the problems
            they
            face. </li>
        <li> Legal and rights training workshops in which the people are informed about the modern capitalist liberal
            democratic
            framework within which they live.</li>
        <li> Collective Action for asserting rights through public demonstrations and sit-ins.</li>
        <li> Revival of labour and resource pooling customs for implementation of survival edge technology.</li>
        <li> Women's meetings to improve their status in society by countering patriarchy and to get them involved in
            resource
            conservation work and public demonstrations.</li>
        <li> Collective Action in the fields of education, health, child protection, cultural rejuvenation, sustainable
            agriculture,
            and identity building.</li>
        Legal and policy advocacy to change the laws and rules in favor of the people.
    </ul>


    <h3 class="general-intro-head"> Gender Based Action </h3>
    <p class="general-para">

        Patriarchy stifles the creativity and freedom of women and girls and so without gender-based action to counter
        it,
        collective action cannot be effective and sustainable. A major problem is the adverse gender division of labour
        and
        the
        burden of repeated childbirths and child care which create reproductive health and psychological problems for
        women.
        Most women suffer in silence because there are no facilities in the public health system to treat these problems
        and
        the
        private doctors are beyond the reach of these women. The Mahila Jagat Lihaaz Samiti runs a high impact
        reproductive
        health program that tries to fill this gap.

    </p>

    <h2 class="general-intro"> Framework of Implementation </h2>
    <p class="general-para">
        <span class="set-graphic"><img src="images/set-sustainable-agri-graphic-2.jpg" alt="Sustainable Agriculture Graphic second" /></span>The overall framework of the implementation of
        <br>
        Survival Edge Technology encompasses work at the grassroots level
        with
        policy and legal advocacy at higher levels up to the national and global, and is represented as shown in the
        schematic
        diagram. The underlying principle is that of subsidiarity which has been defined as - "the central level of
        authority
        shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved either
        at
        the
        regional or the local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better
        achieved at the central level". Thus, this emphasizes a trickle-up theory as opposed to the failed trickle-down
        theory that is
        the basis of modern development practice.</p>
